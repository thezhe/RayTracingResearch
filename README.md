# RayTracingResearch
***My current project*** My research project on ray tracing and shading techniques. 

Future stuff:
Implementing/optimizing raytracing in c++ and using Unity's shaders to create a real-time application. Hope to create a shader that mixes ray tracing with traditional rasterization/baking.
